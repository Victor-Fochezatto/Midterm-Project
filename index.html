		<p id="introp">Canada has been ranked 2nd best country in the world as per the survey done by U.S. News and World Report, global brand consultants BAV Consulting and University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of business you can find a link to the note <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/3983045/canada-no-2-best-countries/"> here</a>. The purpose of this website is to assist new International or foreign students to adapt and find better ways to work, study and live in Vancouver <br>
        Below you will find a couple of things to consider when moving to Canada:</p><br>
	<div><h2>Weather</h2>
		<p>The climate of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada is a moderate oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb) that borders on a warm-summer Mediterranean climate Csb. With summer months that are typically dry, often resulting in moderate drought conditions, usually in July and August. In contrast, the rest of the year is rainy, especially between October and March.<br>Like the rest of the British Columbia Coast, the city is tempered by the North Pacific Current, which has its origins in the milder Kuroshio Current and is also to an extent, sheltered by the mountains of Vancouver Island, to the west.</p>

	<h2>Diversity</h2>
		<p>Generations of immigrants have received a warm welcome to Canada. Multiculturalism is part of the Canadian ethos, and central to national policy.<br>
			Over 40 sitting Members of Parliament were born abroad. In any major city, as well as many rural communities for that matter, you will encounter myriad languages, religions, and cultures. <br>
			You don’t need to let go of your culture or values after moving to Canada, but you do need to evolve so that you can successfully adjust and have the greatest chance of achieving success. Keeping an open mind will benefit you, as well as those around you.</p><img id="diversity" src="images/diversity.jpg" alt="Diversity image">
	<h2>Cost of living</h2>
		<p>Avoid a harsh welcome to Canada by knowing the basic cost of living in your adopted city before you move. If you move and are surprised by how expensive rent or transportation is, that’s not the city’s fault — it’s yours.<br> 
		Research is crucial. Toronto and Vancouver, particularly the downtown areas, are relatively expensive. Rent-controlled Montreal, on the other hand, has low property values and low rent, but also lower salaries.</p><img id="costl" src="images/costliving.jpg" alt="cost of living bar"></div> <br></article>

		<h3>Whale Watching</h3>

		<p> srom March to October each year, thousands of whales migrate through the waters near Vancouver,  making it one of the world’s best locations for whale watching. See our photos below to get an idea of  what you’ll see on your upcoming whale watching trip. A number of tour operators offer whale watching  expeditions around the Gulf and San Juan islands, so you can spot pods of whales from a high-speed  zodiac, fully-equipped cruiser, kayak or seaplane.</p>
